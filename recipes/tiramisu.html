    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coffee at room temperature</li>
            <li>Espresso powder</li>
            <li>Kahlua</li>
            <li>Egg Yolks</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Mascarpone Cheese</li>
            <li>Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>Ladyfingers (Savoiardi)</li>
            <li>Dutch Processed Cocoa Powder</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the Coffee Soak: </strong>Brew the coffee and stir in the espresso powder and Kahlua. Cool completely.</li>
            <li><strong>Whip Egg Yolks and Sugar: </strong>Beat the raw egg yolks and sugar until thick and pale. Add a little additional Kahlua and whisk until combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Mascarpone: </strong>Add the mascarpone to the egg yolks and beat until no lumps remain.</li>
            <li><strong>Whip the Cream: </strong>Beat the heavy cream to medium-stiff peaks. Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture.</li>
            <li><strong>Dip and Layer Ladyfingers: </strong>Quickly roll the ladyfingers through the coffee mixture until the cookies have absorbed some of the coffee but are not soggy. Arrange half the ladyfingers in a baking dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread the Filling: </strong>Spread half the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, dust with cocoa powder, and then repeat with another layer of the soaked ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone.</li>
            <li><strong>Chill: </strong>Refrigerate the tiramisu for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight. Just before serving, dust with additional cocoa powder or chocolate shavings.</li>
        </ol>
